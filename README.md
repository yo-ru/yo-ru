### Hi, I'm Yoru ðŸ‘‹

I'm mainly a Python developer. I program in several languages including Python (obviously), Java, JavaScript, PHP, Swift, and much more! I'm the creator of [gulag-web](https://github.com/Yo-ru/gulag-web) (now [guweb](https://github.com/varkaria/guweb), the frontend appearance of [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag), a osu! server protocol written in modern asynchronous Python. I'm currently a student in High School striving to do what I love, programming!
