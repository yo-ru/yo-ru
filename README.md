### Hi, I'm Sebastian! ðŸ‘‹

I go by "Yoru" or "Night" online. I'm mainly a Python developer. I program in several languages including Python (obviously), Java, JavaScript, PHP, Swift, and many more! I'm the creator of [gulag-web](https://github.com/yo-ru/gulag-web) (now [guweb](https://github.com/varkaria/guweb)), the frontend appearance of [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag), a osu! server protocol written in modern asynchronous Python. I'm currently a student in Freshmen in College striving to do what I love, programming! You can learn more about me on [my website](https://sebastianbishop.com)!
